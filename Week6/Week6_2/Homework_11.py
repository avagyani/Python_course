"""Create a function to perform basic arithmetic operations that includes 
addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on a string number 
(e.g. "12 + 24" or "23 - 21" or "12 // 12" or "12 * 21").
Here, we have 1 followed by a space, operator followed by another space and 
2. For the challenge, we are going to have only two numbers between 1 valid 
operator. The return value should be a number.
eval() is not allowed. In case of division, whenever the second number equals 
'0' return -1.
For example:
'15 // 0'  ➞ -1
Examples
arithmetic_operation('12 + 12') ➞ 24 // 12 + 12 = 24
arithmetic_operation('12 - 12') ➞ 24 // 12 - 12 = 0
arithmetic_operation('12 * 12') ➞ 144 // 12 * 12 = 144
arithmetic_operation('12 // 0') ➞ -1 // 12 / 0 = -1
Notes
All the inputs are only integers.
The operators are * - + and //.
Hint: Think about the single space that appears before and after the 
arithmetic operator."""



arithmetic_operation = ('12 // 0')
lst_operator = arithmetic_operation.strip()
lst_operator = lst_operator.split()

if lst_operator[1] == "//" and lst_operator[2] == "0":
    result = -1
else:
    if lst_operator[1] == "+":
        result = int(lst_operator[0]) + int(lst_operator[2])
    elif lst_operator[1] == "-":
        result = int(lst_operator[0]) - int(lst_operator[2])
    elif lst_operator[1] == "*":
        result = int(lst_operator[0]) * int(lst_operator[2])
    elif lst_operator[1] == "//":
        result = int(lst_operator[0]) // int(lst_operator[2])
    else:
        result = "invalid operation"

print(result)
