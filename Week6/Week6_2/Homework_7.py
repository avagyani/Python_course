"""Create a function that takes a string as an argument and returns a coded 
(h4ck3r 5p34k) version of the string.
Examples
hacker_speak('javascript is cool') ➞ 'j4v45cr1pt 15 c00l'
hacker_speak('programming is fun') ➞ 'pr0gr4mm1ng 15 fun'
hacker_speak('become a coder') ➞ 'b3c0m3 4 c0d3r'
Notes
In order to work properly, the function should replace all 'a's with 4, 
'e's with 3, 'i's with 1, 'o's with 0, and 's's with 5.
"""
